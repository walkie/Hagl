-- | All games in Hagl can be reduced to one of two kinds of game trees.
--   Each node in a game tree consists of a game state and an action to
--   perform (e.g. a player must make a decision).  Edges between nodes
--   are determined by moves.  For `Discrete` game trees, the edges are
--   given explicitly as a list.  For `Continuous` game trees, the edges
--   are defined implicitly by a function.  Games end when a `Payoff`
--   node is reached.

-- * Games
--

-- | A game has several associated types describing whether the game
--   is discrete or continuous, what type of state it maintains, and
--   the type of moves on edges.  The function `gameTree` is used
--   to get the game tree representation of this game, which is used
--   internally by Hagl for execution and analysis.
class GameTree (TreeType g) => Game g where

  -- The type of the corresponding game tree--either `Discrete` or `Continuous`.
  type TreeType g :: * -> * -> *
  
  -- | The type of state maintained throughout the game (use @()@ for stateless games).
  type State g

  -- | The type of moves that may be played during the game.
  type Move g
  
  -- | A representation of this game as a game tree.
  gameTree :: g -> (TreeType g) (State g) (Move g)

-- | Captures all games whose `TreeType` is `Discrete`.  Do not instantiate 
--   this class directly!
